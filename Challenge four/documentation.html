            <hr>
            <p>The “front-end languages” live in the browser. After you type an address into the address bar at the top 
            and hit the enter/return key, your browser will receive at least an HTML file from the web server. 
            That file will likely tell the browser to request a CSS file and a JavaScript file as well (probably many more than one,
            but we’ll keep it simple). Each of these languages performs a separate but very important function and they work harmoniously
            together to determine how the web page is STRUCTURED (HTML), how it LOOKS (CSS), and how it FUNCTIONS (JavaScript).
            And keep in mind that your browser handles figuring out how to make these files into a functioning web page (not the server).
            </p>

            <p>
            Front-end web development is NOT design (you won’t be playing around in Photoshop or anything), but a front-end developer does apply 
            the work of designers to the web page by translating their well-designed layouts into real code. The front-end developer stands 
            between the designer on one end and the back-end developer on the other, translating the design into code and plugging the data 
            from the back-end developer into the right spots. He or she must also handle all the possible interactions that the user may need 
            to make with the page.
            </p>
            
            <p> On the front end, you will need to be highly conscious of who your user is and how they will be interacting with your web page, 
            because you are building their gateway to your page or product. This may mean gaining a strong understanding of accessibility and 
            things like responsive development down the line, but first you need to build up your toolkit and pick up the fundamentals of the 
            front-end languages.In the following lessons, you’ll get a healthy understanding of each of the three front-end languages 
            (and jQuery, the most popular JavaScript library). To get warmed up, we’ll start at the high level.

            <h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities of a front-end developer.</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The main responsibilities of a front-end developer is to implement the design provided by the 
               graphic designer to a visual websites and help the back-end developer to work with that.
               Always remember that to be a good developer it is really important to have least knowledge about 
               the back-end because if you have the knowledge how the back-end works you can certainly make it 
               simple for the back-end developer.

            <h2 id="how_to">How to become a good front-end developer?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>To be a good front-end developer takes time. You need to practice more and more and continue learning 
                the new things. That's how you become a good front-end developer. Moreover to have the knowledge how 
                the internet work for the developer is also considered a must.

            <h2 id="what_skills">What skills do you need to be a junior front-end developer?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                There are some certain skills you need to be a front-end developer.
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML(<strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage)</li>
                    <li>CSS(<strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heet)</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p> However without these skills if you can master some most common CSS and JavaScript library
                and frameworks it will certainly keep you up in the race to get your first dev job.
